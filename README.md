=======
\#{This App} will help you organize your Kickstarter project by giving you a checklist of things to do and a timeline for the project. We provide a starting checklist, which you modify to be specific to your project. Timelines are assigned to each task on your checklist, so you can see a visual representation of your project from start to finish. Because Kickstarter campaigns are basically fulltime jobs, and because you are your own project manager, \#{this app} will connect with \#{your calendar} and send you friendly reminders to help you stay on task.
